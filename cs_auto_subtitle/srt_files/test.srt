1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,660
 1.

2
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,760
 Mathematics is the language of nature.

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,420
 2.

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:26,000
 Everything around us can be represented and understood through numbers.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,760
 3.

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,760
 As you graph the numbers of any system, patterns emerge.

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,760
 4.

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,760
 Therefore, there are patterns everywhere in nature.

9
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:16,759
 5.

10
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:30,760
 Staying, collateral, rhombus, trapezoid.

11
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,760
 I'm asking you to do what I'm asking everyone in that room.

12
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,760
 All my genius is to look beyond the numbers.

13
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,760
 Look around through them.

14
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,760
 The answer to the questions we don't even know how to ask.

15
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,760
 And if it doesn't yet, it's just...

16
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,760
 Because without it, we're not going anywhere.

17
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:56,760
 We're staying on the ground, we're not flying into space, we're not circling the Earth, and we're certainly not touching it.

18
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,760
 But in my mind...

19
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,760
 In my mind, I'm always there.

20
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,760
 Are you?

21
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,759
 If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you.

22
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:16,759
 If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, and make allowance for their doubting too.

23
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:20,759
 If you can wait and not be tired by waiting.

24
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:23,759
 Or being lied about, don't deal in lies.

25
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,759
 Or being hated, don't give way to hating.

26
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:30,759
 And yet, don't look too good, nor talk too wise.

27
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:34,759
 I've been trying to solve the equation without changing the underlying assumption about time.

28
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:38,759
 If you can dream, and not make dreams your master.

29
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:42,759
 If you can think, and not make thoughts your aim.

30
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:48,759
 If you can meet with triumph and disaster, and treat those two imposters just the same.

31
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:55,759
 If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken, twisted by nays to make trap for fools.

32
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:02,759
 Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, and stoop and build them up with worn out tools.

33
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:08,759
 If you can make one heap of all your winnings, and risk it on one turn, and pitch and toss.

34
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:14,759
 And lose, and start again at your beginnings, and never breathe a word about your loss.

35
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:20,759
 If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew to serve your turn long after they are gone.

36
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:27,759
 And so hold on when there is nothing in you, except the will that says to them, hold on.

37
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,759
 Then let's succeed.

38
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,759
 If you can talk with crowds, and keep your virtue.

39
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,759
 Or walk with kings, nor lose the common touch.

40
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:40,759
 If neither foes, nor loving friends can hurt you.

41
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:44,759
 If all men count with you, but none too much.

42
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:50,759
 If you can fill the unforgiving minute, with sixty seconds worth of distance run.

43
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:54,759
 Yours is the earth, and everything that's in it.

44
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:58,759
 And which is more, you'll be a man my son.

45
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:02,759
 Did you just solve Rima?

46
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:05,759
 You think you can find me the Fermi frame from this data?

47
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,759
 In the Graham Schmidt?

48
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,759
 What's the organization algorithm you said?

49
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,759
 I prefer it over you, Corwin Corwin.

50
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,759
 The probability of happiness.

51
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:16,759
 You're close.

52
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:19,759
 Some integer of zero, but no.

53
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,759
 You were right.

54
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,759
 Cause she's theorem will work.

55
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,759
 Before I had a thirty three point three percent chance of choosing right.

56
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:36,759
 But after he opens one of the doors, and then he offers me the choice, it's now sixty six point seven percent.

57
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:45,759
 Simple, elegant equation, explain everything.

58
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:52,759
 As you will find in the multiverbal calculus notes, I've known a number of solutions for any given problem.

59
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,759
 Math is always the pinball.

60
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,759
 Invent yourself, and then reinvent yourself.

61
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,759
 Don't swim in the same slough.

62
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,759
 Invent yourself, and then reinvent yourself.

63
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,759
 And stay out of the clutches of mediocrity.

64
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,759
 Invent yourself, and then reinvent yourself.

65
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:11,759
 Change your tone and shape so often that they can never categorize you.

66
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:16,759
 Reinvigorate yourself, and accept what is.

67
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:21,759
 Put only on the terms that you have invented and reinvented.

68
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,759
 Be self-taught.

69
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,759
 And reinvent your life, because you must.

70
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:35,759
 It is your life, and its history and the present, belong only to you.
